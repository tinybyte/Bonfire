Existential types

Existential types are frequently used in connection with record types to represent modules
and abstract data types, due to their ability to separate implementation from interface.
For example, the type "T = ∃X { a: X; f: (X → int); }" describes a module interface that
has a data member of type X and a function that takes a parameter of the same type X and
returns an integer. This could be implemented in different ways; for example:

    * intT = { a: int; f: (int → int); }
    * floatT = { a: float; f: (float → int); }

These types are both subtypes of the more general existential type T and correspond to concrete
implementation types, so any value of one of these types is a value of type T.
Given a value "t" of type "T", we know that "t.f(t.a)" is well-typed,
regardless of what the abstract type X is. This gives flexibility for choosing types suited to
a particular implementation while clients that use only values of the interface type—the
existential type—are isolated from these choices.

In general it's impossible for the typechecker to infer which existential type a given module
belongs to. In the above example intT { a: int; f: (int → int); } could also have the type
∃X { a: X; f: (int → int); }. The simplest solution is to annotate every module with its
intended type, e.g.:

    * intT = { a: int; f: (int → int); } as ∃X { a: X; f: (X → int); }

Although abstract data types and modules had been implemented in programming languages for
quite some time, it wasn't until 1988 that John C. Mitchell and Gordon Plotkin established
the formal theory under the slogan: "Abstract [data] types have existential type".[5]
The theory is a second-order typed lambda calculus similar to System F,
but with existential instead of universal quantification.

existential type  An existential type includes references to type variables
that are unknown.  For example, Array[T] forSome { type T } is
an existential type.  It is an array of T, where T is some completely
unknown type. All that is assumed about T is that it exists at all. This
assumption is weak, but it means at least that an Array[T] forSome
{ type T } is indeed an array and not a banana.
