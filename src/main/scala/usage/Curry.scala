  Original artical for this: http://www.codecommit.com/blog/scala/function-currying-in-scala
  It turns out that the best rationale for using currying has to do with general and specialized functions.
  It would be nice to define a function for the general case,
  but allow users to specialize the function and then used the specialized version on different data sets.
  Take the following code as an exampl

    lazy val recurse = process(filter) _ //the underscore just tells the compiler to treat the suffixed value as a functional, rather than a method to be evaluated.

    list match {
      case head :: tail => if (filter(head)) {
        head :: recurse(tail)
      } else {
        recurse(tail)

  val numbersAsc = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: 4 :: 5 :: Nil
  val numbersDesc = 5 :: 4 :: 3 :: 2 :: 1 :: Nil

  processEvens(numbersAsc) // [2, 4]
